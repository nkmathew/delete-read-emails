### Delete Read Emails

Thunderbird extension that deletes all the read emails in your inbox with a click of
a button. Created cause I seem to be the only one who needs this or I'm somehow
doing this the wrong way. How does everyone else delete the 30+ read emails over and
over without selecting and hitting delete?
